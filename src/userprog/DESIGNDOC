			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct data_in_both {
    int count;
    struct lock both_lock;
    int status;
    tid_t tid;
    struct semaphore dead_sema;
    struct list_elem child_elem;
};
This struct is used to hold all of the data that will be shared between a parent 
and child process.


struct give_to_child {
    bool load_success;
    char* file_name;
    struct semaphore load_sema;
    struct data_in_both* shared;
};
Allows the parent to pass its data to the child that it creates. 

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

Pintos implements strtok_r() because it is more threadsafe than strtok().  
It also allows  us to place the address of the arguments in a memory location that
can be accessed at a later time.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

We think that the shell saves the kernel time, because the shellmakes sure that we pass
a valid executable so the kernel doesn't have to do it.

			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room
>> for improvement in these numbers, and how much?

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system
>> call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three
>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and
>> error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary
>> function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when
>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?
